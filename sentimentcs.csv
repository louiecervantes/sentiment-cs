Definitely certain that humans dont stand a chance against AI when it comes to which can do a better job at building software.  It is time for people to rethink their careers.  At some point AI will be able to self-replicate meaning software will self-correct and optimize all by itself with no need for human intervention.,1
because AI is getting more and more smarter each day. We might have already reached the technological singularity. AI will be able to generate fully functional codes in the near future. ,1
"AI has a lot of advantages today and it can be better than CS professionals. In that reason, most CS professionals will lose their jobs and expertise just because AI is better than them. AI may have a lot of advantages, and just because CS professionals are just humans and have lots of limitations, there's a possibility that AI will overpower these professionals. ",1
"As the technology improves, it will definitely replace entry-level employees but that doesn't mean we are doomed, it just means we can focus more on the things only humans can do. It could be on the creative side, empathetic side, or even pushing for actual breakthroughs in technology. The latter means we don't need to dwell as much on the basics or take as much time researching for snippets to aid us in our work",0
"For me, I can say that the idea that AI will make computer science professionals obsolete is a flawed one. While AI can certainly automate certain tasks and make them more efficient, it cannot replicate the creativity, problem-solving ability, and critical thinking skills that humans possess. Furthermore, AI is still in its infancy and will require humans to continue developing and improving it. Therefore, rather than viewing AI as a threat, computer science professionals should embrace it as a tool to augment their skills and enhance their work.",0
"First of all, CS professionals are one of the capable individuals that can make or break most of our modern technologies. Hence, I truly believe that AI can't overlap these kind of individuals. Although it is possible that AI can be a tool for these individuals to help improve our society for the better.",0
"If it gets to the point where AI can comprehend incredibly complex thought, assess and predict what happens next, then I think it might replace professionals in the industry. It happened numerous times in the past and it'll happen again. Industrial Machines for example, a lot of protests were conducted, riots everywhere, but in the end, no one can deny how helpful it has been to progress the human race. ",1
"CS professionals will not be obsolete even though AI becomes mainstream as they perform a comprehensive complex tasks that involve critical thinking, creativity, and human judgment in which AI cannot. Also, they can adapt and evolve with advancing technologies, allowing AI as a tool to improve their work rather than replacing them. Establishing a symbiotic relationship between the two parties instead of seeing them as adversaries is the key.",0
"I believe that CS professionals is better than AI because professionals are the ones who made AI possible and work well. Without these professionals, AI will not be established, so AI cannot make them obsolete because all the knowledge it has came from the work of these professionals. Therefore, CS professionals are still better than AI in all areas. ",0
"Professionals have the advantage of being 'humane' in the sense as at some point more and more people will doubt the integrity of any given system if it is tainted by corporate hands. People are more willing to acknowledge or accept change or ideas if it was from someone they can relate to or at least on their level. Personally, I think it's is going to be an indispensable tool for any CS professional going forward.",0
"AI will make CS professionals obsolete because it has unlimited knowledge that no one human can comprehend. In that case, AI will be more useful and productive than these professionals. AI is better than CS professionals in any way and will take over the works of these professionals.",1
"CS professionals will not become obsolete because of AI because these professionals can do better than AI. These professionals does have the foundation or knowledge that made AI work. In short, CS professionals can still work better and AI because they're the ones who established AI.",0
" My answer is no. While AI has made significant advancements in recent years, it is still limited to performing specific tasks. It cannot fully replace the creativity, problem-solving skills, and adaptability that humans bring to the table. ",0
"AI technology has limitations, particularly in areas that require creativity, critical thinking, and complex problem-solving. While AI can process vast amounts of data quickly, it cannot replicate human intuition and reasoning, which are crucial for many CS tasks. CS professionals also bring a unique perspective and context to their work, which AI cannot replicate.",0
"Even if AI technology were to become advanced enough to replicate the work of CS professionals entirely, there will still be a need for human oversight and accountability. CS professionals are responsible for ensuring the ethical and responsible use of AI technology, and this requires human judgment and decision-making. Therefore, while AI technology may transform the field of CS, it will not make CS professionals obsolete.",0
"I think CS professional will not be obsolete but their work will be more easier. AI will just be an aiding tool for the CS professional to make their work error free, hassle-free, and faster. With this, I could say that it will not totally replace the work of CS professional but a tool to help them.",0
"Yes it can. If we look at the chances, there is a chance AI will replace CS professionals. Most people will deny it for now.",1
Yes it can. People are trying to make one then and deny it. CS professionals are developing AI that can do task like CS professionals and it will make as hypocrite to deny it will not happen.,1
"No, because as technology advance, the way humans develop things also progresses. Computer Science professionals specifically, will be able to express their ideas more without having to spend hours fixing a single error or bug. Additionally, AI overcoming the controls of humans is laughable, and Computer Scientists will not permit that there job will become obsolete",0
"Artificial Intelligence or AI is better than CS professionals because it has much broader knowledge in all things. AI can take the works that most humans have and do it more efficiently than us. With that, AI is more reliable and better than professionals.",1
